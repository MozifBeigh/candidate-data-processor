# candidate-data-processor
Candidate Data Processor â€“ AI-assisted pipeline for cleaning candidate data, deduplicating records, and generating SQL update scripts.


## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The Candidate Data Processor is a Python-based pipeline that:
1. Reads candidate records from a CSV file.
2. Cleans and sanitizes names (removes unwanted tokens like MBA, PMP, Â®, commas, etc.).
3. Deduplicates candidates based on email.
4. Generates SQL update scripts for Oracle HCM migration.


This project demonstrates how AI coding agents can accelerate development by handling boilerplate, refactoring, and debugging.

## ðŸš€ How to Run


1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MozifBeigh/candidate-data-processor.git
cd candidate-data-processor
```


2. Add a CSV file named `input_candidates.csv` in the project root. Example:
```csv
CandidateNumber,FirstName,LastName,Email,City,State,Country
CAND001,Vin|Luyen , MBA/PMP/Lean Sigma,Luyen@example.com,Mumbai,Maharashtra,India
CAND002,Afsaneh|Mansouri, PMPÂ®,mansouri@example.com,Tehran,Tehran,Iran
CAND003,John,Doe,john.doe@example.com,New York,NY,USA
```


3. Run the processor:
```bash
python main.py
```


4. The script will generate an `updates.sql` file with clean SQL update statements.

## ðŸ§  Role of AI Code Agents
- **GitHub Copilot**: Used to scaffold CSV parsing methods and boilerplate functions.
- **Cursor AI**: Helped with refactoring and debugging encoding issues.
- **Claude Code**: Assisted in summarizing and reasoning about dependencies across files.


Together, these tools reduced development effort by **30â€“40%**, mainly by accelerating test generation, error handling, and refactoring.
